            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Afterward ſtirred vp by their example, commeth this Portugal Monke into the field, as making vp the arrier guard of this Roman army: to whoſe worke the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> of <hi>Tournon</hi> haue contributed, to the end that after the knocking together of ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pates, they may need no more to begin. In me it might be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great preſumption to wraſtle with ſo many men, and ſo loaden with titles, if the word of God ſtood in awe of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
<pb facs="tcp:11477:7"/>
For hee might bee holden for a mad man, who in a matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in liew of waighing the reaſons ſhould fal to numbring of the perſons. Truth is of more force in the mouth of one man onely, then vntruth in the mouthes of many, whoſe conſpiracies againſt the truth of the Goſpell reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the humming of a neaſt of waſps that in ſtinging doe loſe their ſtinges. how ever it is, it ſeemeth that this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe hath ſtung ſome of them to the quicke: with ſo great ſtrife doe they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault it. And indeed the gaule and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that herein they doe ſpue forth doth ſhew them to be vehemently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. They tearme me a beaſt, a foole, a ſot, a deceaver, an hereticke, an impious parſon, a dolt, execrable, impudent, &amp;c. They ſend me quick into hell, yea they rather want words then ſtomack. They are ſorrie that our language is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtored with iniurious phraſes: and God hee knoweth what people they are! But God grant that this their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:11477:8"/>
may be to them a purgation, that God may not iudge them with ſo great rigour, as they doe vs with raſhneſſe. This is all the revenge that I do deſire: for what other intereſt haue we in this action then the glory of God and the ſalvation of ſuch as hate vs? Whoſe ſtripes and blowes when they cannot penetrate into the truth doe reflect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my perſon. But herein doe I boaſt that they be honorable bruiſes. Theſe barkings I beare as of men ſtarved, and as ſome portion of the reproches of my ſaviour Chriſt, who was in like manner outraged, and for our ſalvation bare more ſorrows the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffer wrongs for his glory. Now albeit an impudent boldneſſe be the only way to atchieue reputation of skill, yet am not I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to practiſe, that courſe: neither to requite theſe Doctors with ſuch quoine. This attempt I deſpiſe &amp; laugh at ſuch impetuoſitie: yea I even take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of it, as of a diſeaſe of the minde and a convulſion. Neither is it indeed
<pb facs="tcp:11477:8"/>
my cauſe, it is the cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt, whom we are not to defend but by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of him; for how can we plead the cauſe of the Lambe of God with wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh hearts and poiſoned ſtomackes? Yet is their wrath in ſome ſort excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for in quenching their Purgatory, what do you but put theſe our Maſters to an hungry diſpute, by ſtopping the currant of their trafficke, cutting their ſinews, &amp; breaking the wheeles of this great frame of the Roman hierarchie? For as a beaſt deadly wounded, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth with an extraordinarie force, even ſo theſe Doctors doe exceſſiuely ſtorme, when you touch them in their beſt feeling: that is in the belly, in Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and in Idleneſſe. Of all the reſt this Portugal Monk is the moſt ridiculouſly violent: hee ſpeaketh with a barbarous impetuoſitie: with ſuch a pride as hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeth with his habit: yet did I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare his honour and abſtaine from all iniuries and bravadoes, albeit I had a large field open before me, and many

To theſe books thus ſtuffed with civilitie haue theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctors impoſed Capriccious titles after the manner of thoſe that hang out ſcurrilous tables over the forefronts of the houſes where they act their enterludes: or as ſuch as carue <hi>Cyclops</hi> and <hi>Satyres</hi> vpon the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice of their buildings.<note place="margin">CAYER.</note> Marke then the title of <hi>Cayers</hi> booke. <hi>The burning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, or oven of reverberate &amp;c.</hi> And in his booke his ſpeech runneth all vpon <hi>Limbecks</hi> firing, evaporating, recalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c.

eſtranged from our beliefe. As thus: that we beleeue fiue manſions for the ſoules: that our drift is to deny the Immortalitie of the ſoule: that wee make al ſinnes alike equal: that we hold that the ſoules doe ſleep from the day of their deceaſe to the day of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that wee would haue I wot not what Synode [that never was] to paſſe for an article of faith: that baptiſme was not neceſſarie for any but the children of vnbeleevers: that out of our Kalenders we haue raiſed the Virgin Mary &amp; the Apoſtles, and in their places haue inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin:</hi> that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doe preach liberty of conſcience without any apprehenſion of divine iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that we hold that it ſufficeth vs that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered for vs, and therefore that wee neede not doe any more: that at the Funerals of the late Queene of England they ſung Maſſe, had their offertory and prayed for her ſoule: that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> in liew of raiſing the dead to life did put the living

            <p>What ſhall I ſpeak of their vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in alleaging the Scriptures? All the paſſages that they produce are for the moſt part either falſified, or wreſted to a contrary ſenſe, or to no purpoſe. With a Magiſteriall licenſe they force a number of paſſages quoined vpon the anvill of Avarice, that are not to be found in the originals, either Greeke, or Hebrew: yea and ſometimes contrary to the Roman tranſlations. Of ſo much negligence or dulneſſe of their reader do they preſume, aſſuring themſelues that the people ſhall never perceaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, or can ſo much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult with the Scriptures, which vnto them are as ſealed letters and ſuſpected bookes: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in the meane time they are permit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to read the monſtrous Legends: the
<pb facs="tcp:11477:14"/>
Pſalters of the Virgin Mary ful fraught with blaſphemy: and the frivolous and and fabulous bookes of the life of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. O yee ſoules that long for your ſalvation, will you ſtill liue in ſuch grievous bondage? What? ſhall we yet be ſo vaine as to paſſe the ſeas to looke vpon the relickes of ſome Saints, and will we not heare Ieſus Chriſt when he offereth himſelfe vnto vs in the holy Scriptures?

Placing pietie in the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nothing; thruſting our ſelues into the preſſe and ſhrowding vs amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the multitude? Againe, when any man ſhall ſay vnto vs that Ieſus Chriſt or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Apoſtles do in ſuch a place, or in ſuch a place teach vs Purgatory, or the Invocation of ſaints, &amp;c. Shall wee
<pb facs="tcp:11477:14"/>
be ſo cruelly cowards to our ſelues, or ſo vnthankfull to God, as not to take ſo much paines as to look whether the ſame be truely alleaged? And indeed wherefore ſhould theſe Doctors cite the places but that we might ſee them? For what an abſurditie is this, to quote the places to the people and then to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barre them from ſeeing of them: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them to the places and then to command them not to looke in the booke? The people of <hi>Beroe</hi> practiſed this examination of the things that <hi>S.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not proceed from a ſoul aſſured of her ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Surely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe praiers were firſt penned, theſe matters were not yet well conſidered of, and this may we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gather from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, who in his dialogues placeth the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of ſome ſouls in bathes, of ſome vnder the leaues, and of ſome vnder the Ice: and this do theſe three champions that haue aſſaulted my treatiſe, both ſay and defend: for nothing to them is to hard or to hot. <hi>Damian</hi> ſpeaketh of a ſoule that had her Purgatory in a river, but whither ſhe ſwam with the ſtream or againſt it, he ſaith not. The Roſarie of Bernardine hath of this nature ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny revelations: and the Legend of <hi>S.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11477:26"/>
brought news, yet did the matter ſtill reſt full of doubt, vntil the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> which among other occaſions was aſſembled to perſwade Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Greeke Churches, who both before and yet do deny it, albeit their deputies in the Councell did agree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in hope of ſuccours againſt the Turk. True it is that we find ſome more ancient Councels, which made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prayer for the dead: but hereafter we ſhall moſt evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proue that theſe prayers make nothing for Purgatory: alſo that ſuch prayers as we find among the ancients doe plainely ſhewe that they beleeved no Purgatory. Even to this day doe the Greek Churches pray for the dead: yet doe they deny Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. In the laſt ſeſſion therefore of this Councell holden in the yeare 1539. was it defined, that wee ſhould beleeue Purgatory: In which Counſell, as in all others holden within theſe fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, the Pope ſat preſident, and that with ſuch auctority that hee grew

But to returne to our Matter. The ſoules thus purged in this fire are brought into Paradice. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit becauſe this purgation will growe ſomewhat long, the Popes mercy doth ſometimes abridge this puniſhment: For beſides that the paines that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving haue vndergon for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as faſtes: almes: whippings, pilgrimages, libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to the Church, &amp;c. alſo that the Maſſes fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the deceaſed, which leaue any rents or annuities to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

or abbey, or other religious houſe [if we may beleeue thoſe that ſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>] are of great vſe to mitigate and allay the heat of Purgatory, and to diminiſh the paines thereof, yet haue the Popes found out a more ready and gallant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to the ſame end: and this it is. Hee raketh together all the ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfactions as wel of Ieſus Chriſt as of all his Saints which remain in the treaſurie of the Church, whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth carrie the keyes: and theſe doth he diſtribute among his Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the freeing of ſoules out of the fire of Purgatorie. To the ſame vſe doth he alſo apply his hallowed graines and medals which hee diſtributeth abroad, granting hundreds and thouſandes of yeares of pardon, to all ſuch as ſhal kiſſe or reverently keepe them. And theſe pardons ſerue not only for this life but alſo for Purgatory. The Church of the <hi>Fevillants</hi> at Paris haue this priviledge, That the Maſſes in that church ſaid for the dead vpon the moonday or wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,

Afterwards from this medow they paſſed into <hi>Limbo:</hi> &amp; thence came forth with Ieſus Chriſt: then did they follow him 40 daies vpon the earth, &amp; finally entered into Paradice.

But now I pray you what be the news that Jeſus Chriſt brought? vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11477:54"/>
even the ſame that the golden legend and the booke of the life and death of Jeſus Chriſt do report: how he came to hel gates and the good thiefe <hi>Dinas</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Croſſe before him: how hee made the gates to be opened: how hee beat and hampered the Divels: how he entertained the fathers whom he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this <hi>Limbo</hi> with goodly diſcourſes, &amp; a thouſande ſuch Iolly gallant hiſtories after the imitation of the Romanes, all which the Evangeliſts had forgotten: for either of theſe, or of any other news that ever Jeſus Chriſt brought out of <hi>Limbo,</hi> out of Purgatory or out of Hell we finde not one ſillable in all the newe Teſtament. The ſouldier raiſed again of whom <hi>S. Gregory Dialogue 4. cap. 36.</hi> doth make mention, and one <hi>Nicholas</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the legend of <hi>S.

about the chimnies like ſmall flames: a bridge of yce of two fingers broad, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the which ran a torrent of fire, and over this bridge muſt they paſſe that were to enter into Paradice. Thus grew the world very skilfull and a good boy: but to the detriment of the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpell. Laſtly he ſaith that <hi>Vnder the olde Teſtament they had no ſuch meanes to releeue the dead, as they had after that the merites of Ieſus Chriſt were committed into the handes of the Church to apply them.</hi> Theſe are three principles forged in the <hi>Vatican</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop the Popes greatnes &amp; to bring in the traffique for ſoules: firſt that the dead could not bee ſo well relieved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Jeſus Chriſt as now they are Secondly, that the merits of Jeſus Chriſt are nowe in the Churches hands to apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thirdly that theſe merits of the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt were never paſſed over to the Church vntill ſince the comming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſince which time the dead
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11477:55"/>
haue beene the better relieved. And this is to bee noted, that by the Church we are to vnderſtand the Pope, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him to be the Guardian and treaſury of this treaſure of the Church, where he ſhutteth vp the merits and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatorie ſatisfactions both of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and of the Saints &amp; Monks. And this we cannot finde very ſtrange:<note place="margin">Diſt. <hi>95.</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa ſatis. <hi>and in the laſt councel of Lateran,</hi> ſeſſ. <hi>9.</hi> Extrav. De facund.

Let vs now therfore proceed to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe three principles.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. <hi>That the dead could not bee ſo well relieved before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt as ſince:</hi> I demande whether he ſpeaketh of the reliefe of man, or of the reliefe of God. To ſay that God hath now better meanes to relieue the dead then he had before is Blaſphemy. His power and goodneſſe are ever infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11477:56"/>
and without encreaſe, and craue no helpe of any new means: but if he ſpeak of the reliefe of man, I aske him who imparted to them now thoſe meanes that their forefathers had not? The Monke no doubt wil ſay that God gaue them to them: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belike God had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If he had then I ſuppoſe he would then haue beſtowed them as wel as men do in theſe daies: whereof it muſt follow that the faithfull that liued before Ieſus Chriſt, might by praiers and ſacrifices haue entreated God to employ thoſe means which ſince he hath committed into hands the of men. Wherefore did they not? Wherefore was there in the law no ſacrifice for the dead? Nor no publike ſervice inſtituted by God? Thus doth this difficulty ſtill remaine vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond principle is, <hi>That the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Ieſus Chriſt were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted into the hands of the Church to apply them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.6.</note> A do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as farre repugnant from the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as helping to the Popes commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11477:56"/>
For by the ſcripture it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt offered himſelfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ranſome to God for vs to whom wee were endebted and enthralled to eternall paine and empriſonment.</hi> This ranſome then did God receiue at his ſonnes hands: If he receiued it, when did he againe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe himſelfe of it, to paſſe it over into the Popes hands? May it be lawful for vs in a matter of ſuch importance, which concerneth the participation in the merites of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſpeake without the authority of the worde of God. Againe, what prodigious dealing is this: that a creditor having received of his debtors ſurety the ranſome for many priſoners, ſhoulde deliver the ſame over into the handes of ſome one of his priſoners, to apply it to the reſt? It is a matter not only without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but even beſides all reaſon. All men do know that in ſuch a caſe it is enough that the creditor or detainer receiue the ranſome, and that the debter or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner reape and enioy the benefit. God
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11477:57"/>
hath for me receaved the full ranſom by the hands of my ſurety &amp; redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Ieſus Chriſt: God then hath it with him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, therefore will I go neither to the Pope nor to any other to entreat them to diſtribute it to me, but will rely onlie vpon Ieſus Chriſt and will truſt to his death, and in acknowledgement of ſo great a favour, will conſecrate my life to his ſervice. The paſtors are ſet over vs to preach this benefit to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner, &amp; to let him vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he is reconciled to God: alſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeveth in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhal through his name obtaine remiſſion of his ſinnes.<note place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note> If our frier ſhall yet invent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon to proue it to bee neceſſarie that the Pope or his Prelates ſhould be the treaſurers and diſpenſers of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Ieſus Chriſt, he ſhal but skirmiſh with him ſelfe: for he ſhal find the ſame neceſſities before the comming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: conſidering that both quick and dead in that age ſtoode in no leſſe neceſſity of Gods graces then they that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11477:57"/>
liue in theſe daies. Againe if the Pope haue in his treaſury the merits of Ieſus Chriſt &amp; his Saints, to diſtribute them to others, how commeth it that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth none to himſelfe? Or why doth he not keepe for himſelfe ſo many as may ſerue to keepe him out of Purgatorie? How is it that after his death they ſaie ſo many Maſſes for his ſoule? Muſt ſillie Prieſts by their Maſſes and ſuffrages ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply &amp; beſtow the merits of Ieſus Chriſt and his Saints vpon him who diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to others, yea even ſo farre forth as to graunt to ſome one an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand yeare: of plenary pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could not reſerue enough for himſelfe, albeit [if we liſt to beleeue him] himſelf continually carryed the keies of this treaſure even to his laſt gaſpe? Where note withall that if the diſtributing and applying of the merits of Ieſus Chriſt to the faithfull, be a part of the Paſtors charge, it followeth that the dead haue no part in this the Popes liberality, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidering that he is no longer their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11477:58"/>
Now let the reader iudge whether this gay principle be not a buttereſſe or prop to ſupport tiranny: that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may thinke that they cannot parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, but by the hands of the Pope, or of ſuch as he doth authorize therevnto.</p>
               <p>The third principle is the worſt, and as it were vpon the higheſt ſtep of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie: and therefore it is our dutie to caſt it downe headlong. The merits of Ieſus Chriſt (ſaith hee) were not in the hands of the Church vnder the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as now they are, and therefore there were not ſo good meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the dead. But here we wil ſet down another principle, gathered out of the word of God. That is, that the merits of Ieſus Chriſt were of power ſufficient to ſaue the faithfull even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, as ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paule, 2. Cor. 5.19. God was in Chriſt and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the world to himſelf, not imputing their ſinnes vnto them.</hi> Therefore in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is he called, <hi>The Lambe ſlaine from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11477:58"/>
the beginning of the world.</hi> This merite was then with God and ful of efficacy, before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh. Let vs then by this rule exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Doctors principle. Before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh, the merit of Ieſus Chriſt was with God: not in the hands of the Church. Then [ſaith this Doctor] the dead had the leſſe helpe: but ſince the Pope and his Prelats had theſe merits in their hands, the dead haue beene much better relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the merits therfore of Ieſus Chriſt are in better hands and more liberall. Is it becauſe God is not ſo well affected to the dead as the Pope? Or becauſe the Pope is more liberal of anothers goods then the true owner? O ſpirit of Satan! O dulneſſe of man! O patience of God! And ſhall not God revenge ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable prophanation of his glory? Or ſuch evident corruption of his worde? Let vs lament &amp; confeſſe that our ſins haue deſerued a greater blindneſſe. Yet in the meane time we muſt not forget
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11477:59"/>
that our adverſaries doe commit the merits of Jeſus Chriſt into the Popes hand, that he may apply them both to the quicke and to the dead: &amp; that they ſay, that ſince he was treaſurer the dead haue beene much better relieved, it muſt needes followe that not only the dead before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Ieſus Chriſt were but ſlenderly relieued but alſo the living: ſo with like reaſon may wee ſay that the praiers for the living vnder the old Teſtament were nothing ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and publicke as they haue beene ſince the merits of Ieſus Chriſt fell into the handes of the Church to apply them: but this the frier dare not advow. Thus is falſehood detected and laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the ſpirit of blaſphemy put to confuſion. Now in all this diſcourſe the Friers drift tendeth to yeeld ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon why the prayers and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for the dead are not ſo frequent in the old Teſtament: wherein he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth two frauds. Firſt in ſaying they were not frequent, he vnderhand leaues
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11477:59"/>
it to be preſuppoſed that they were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſomtimes, which is falſe. For therof we find neither example, nor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in all the olde Teſtament. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ſeeking to excuſe the want in the old Teſtament, he giueth occaſion to the ignorant to thinke that the ſame were very frequent in the new, which alſo is falſe. For in the new Teſtament we heare no more newes thereof then in the old. Only there is one place that inſtructeth vs how the faithfull ſhould beare themſelues towardes the dead, wherein there is not any ſpeech of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, Purgatory, or Indulgences. The place is in the Theſſalonians, 1.4.13. in theſe words. <hi>I would not brethren haue you ignorant as concerning them that are aſleepe. That you ſorrow not, even as others that haue no hope: for if we beleeue that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is dead, and is riſen againe, even ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſleepe in Ieſus will God bring with him.</hi> Herein is nothing that commeth any thing neere the trafficke and trade of theſe daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:11477:60"/>The whole ſum of this Chapter is this, that the holy Scripture is ſufficient to inſtruct vs to ſalvation: that it ought to decide theſe controverſies: that the ſacrifices &amp; ſuffrages for the dead, with the fetching of ſoules out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Buls and Indulgences, are neither by God inſtituted or commanded, and that even by the confeſſions of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; who in al their burning books cannot produce any commandement of God touching the ſame; but to ſhroud themſelues doe produce other points, which they pretend to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the holy Scriptures. Being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of theſe weapons, which are their ſureſt, they ſhelter themſelues vnder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and wanting the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, they haue recourſe to examples, allegories, &amp; coniectures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as men that catch vp ſtones, when they haue no ſwords. Wee will ſhewe you as it were at high noone, that their examples are falſe, their allegories fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, their coniectures vaine, &amp; their

For what kind of merit is this, to receaue the gifts and graces of God with a ſtedfaſt faith, which faith alſo God gaue him, who giueth not only the benefits, but alſo the means to receaue them? And the ſame doe I ſay alſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues which were the gifts and effects of the ſpirit of God in him: <hi>For it is God that worketh the will and the deed</hi> ſaith <hi>S.

That which I hold to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall in this caſe is this. That theſe our Maſters doe make the charitie, zeale &amp; patience of this thiefe in a moment to be of ſo great merit as to exempt him from the torments of Purgatory: yet that they will not graunt that the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the faithfull that are in this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire, their zeale, or any other the vertues which in theſe ſoules were in greater perfection then they were in the thiefe [in that hee was yet a ſinner] could haue any merit, or power to draw them out of this fire. But wherefore

ſhould they by their magiſterial aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie take from theſe poore ſoules the power of meriting but only by prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the torments of the dead, the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſciences of the living being the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, might bee ſtirred vp to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them whiles they may by maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, anniverſaries, &amp; gifts to the Church? yea and that ſo far forth as to perſwade the people that an offering for the dead being by a ſurviver offred, was of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and merit to free the dead from that torment: and yet that in the dead him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neither his faith, neither his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither his patience, no not the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many yeares haue any merit, or can moue God to abridge this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? 7. Hereto let vs alſo adioine thus much, that the puniſhment that the thiefe ſuffered, being deſerved, inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and by civill iuſtice impoſed vpon him, could not bee counted for a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie worke to God: for hee ought voluntarily to haue vndergon it, and by order of the Church, not by ſentence

For God hath ſhewed himſelfe infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſt in accepting at the hands of our pledge and redeemer Ieſus Chriſt a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient price for all our offences: alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly mercifull, in allowing to vs this payment, as made in our name.

But to pardon a man all his ſins and yet to make the ſame man to beare
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11477:77"/>
one part of the deſerved puniſhment for ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſame, are matters contradictory.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11477:78"/>
falſe and yet in queſtion: namely that the paines whereto the faithful be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> be ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, payments and redemptions to the Iuſtice of God. For of this kinde of paines do we now entreat, becauſe they make Purgatory to be of this nature. We ſay then that al theſe evils, labours, diſeaſes, yea even death it ſelfe, do alter their nature in the faithfull: and of evils become medicines. Of ſatisfactorie pains they are made healthſome exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the ſoule: God by the wounds of the body healeth the woundes of the ſoule: even in like manner as a triakle compoſed of venimous Ingrediences, yet tempered by a skilfull Phyſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a very healthſome preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. The like do we ſay of the death of the faithfull. It reſembleth the paſſage over the red ſea, where Gods enemies are ſwallowed vp: but his children doe finde way to the promiſed inheritance. Farthermore if it be a puniſhment to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God wherfore do
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11477:78"/>
the faithful expect it with Ioie, and in their deſires even haſten the comming of it, as did the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paule. Phil. 1.13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe reaſons they alleadge many examples as of <hi>Mary, Moſes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> who were puniſhed after their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences were forgiven. Namely <hi>David</hi> whoſe example they do vrge: <hi>2. Sam. 12.</hi> Where God having forgiven him his ſinne, ſaid nevertheleſſe vnto him, <hi>The ſword ſhall not depart from thy houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt deſpiſed me.</hi> Againe, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt given the Lordes enemies cauſe to blaſpheme his name, thy childe ſhall die.</hi> There is not ſay they, <hi>to the end thou ſhouldeſt not cauſe to blaſpheme.</hi> Likewiſe in the 7. of <hi>Micheas: I will beare the wrath of the Lorde, becauſe I haue ſinned againſt him:</hi> wherein their iudgement fayleth them: for they labour to proue that which we do grant. Who denieth but that the ſins of the faithfull are the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes of the chaſtiſementes that God layeth vpon them? And that they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11477:79"/>
fall vpon them becauſe they haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? But our controverſie dependeth not vpon the efficient cauſe but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the finall. They ſay that it is to the end that Gods iuſtice may be ſatisfied by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the ſinne: we ſay that it is to the end A ſinner may amend. They will haue it. That God puniſheth as a iuſt iudge: we that he puniſheth vs as a loving father: not to exerciſe his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but correct our vnrighteouſneſſe: for as for the ſatisfaction due to his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the merits of Jeſus Chriſt are a ſufficient ſatisfaction. The father that puniſheth his children to take ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, putteth of his naturall affections &amp; correcteth them, not for their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to ſatisfie his owne content. Now if this bee an Inhumane iuſtice in a father, what ſhall wee thinke of our heavenly father who is bounty it ſelfe? And who in his worde aſſureth vs that albeit the mother ſhoulde forſake the fruit of her wombe, yet will hee never forſake vs? Never ſhall wee ſerue God

The pardon therefore that God graunted, was only the grant of <hi>Moſes</hi> petition, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God that he would not vtterly root out the people of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> But heare we are not in hand with any ſuch kinde of pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In an other place he produceth the example of Baptiſme and ſaith in Baptiſme God pardoneth Original ſin, but not the paines thereof, as ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to death, the fire of concupiſcence, with other calamities.

They ſay that Jeſus Chriſt giveth vs power to pay a debt, which himſelfe hath already paid to the full, and to ſatisfie for that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquited: who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imagine, or rather who would not ſpite that a ſurety, who hath ſet a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at liberty by paying his debt for him, ſhould after make him pay to the ſame creditor the ſame debt that him hath already paid: yea &amp; which is more: that the ſame ſecond payment ſhoulde be accompted a grace and favour? who could ever haue thought that the pains and torments of Purgatory had beene counted among the graces of Ieſus Chriſt? But ſay they, it is a grace to giue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11477:84"/>
power to the creature to ſatisfie of him ſelfe that is to ſay, to beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne ſin. Let vs learne; for this is a new kind of beneficence, A cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall perſon ſhal hereafter commend the bounty of his iudge, who after hee hath freely forgiven him, ſhall of his grace and ſuperabundant mercy, cauſe him to bee whipped about the towne, and to pay exceſſiue amends, that ſo he may haue the honor to ſatisfie for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Now if Purgatory bee a grace of God, why doth the Pope come with his Indulgences, vniuſtly officious, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this grace? Againe, if it be a favour or a grace that God granteth to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature to ſatisfie for himſelfe, the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhall be his favorites, whom he will make to pay to the full.

                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:11477:119"/>Now to furniſh ſo notable a libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Pope hath laide a bottomeleſſe foundation, which he nameth <hi>The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Church:</hi> and it is compoſed of the ſuperabundance of the merits &amp; ſuffrings both of Ieſus Chriſt and of his Saints. This he diſtributeth among the ſouls of the dead, to helpe them out of Purgatory, &amp; it is manifeſtly laid down in the Extravagants of <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixt which beginneth <hi>Vnigenitus.</hi>

               <p>To enter therefore into the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this new Goſpell. 1. We aske who gaue the Pope power to fetch ſoules out of Purgatory? 2. Let them produce either commandement or example of any Indulgences given to the deade by the Apoſtles or by their firſt ſucceſſours. 3. If it bee a new benevolence, how commeth it that God is now become more liberall
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:11477:120"/>
then heretofore? 4. If al the power that the Pope aſſumeth to himſelfe were firſt promiſed in theſe words, <hi>I will giue thee the kayes, &amp;c.</hi> when was it actually conferred? It was [ſay they] when Ieſus Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Feed my Lambs.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it was ſpoken to the Pope, and that <hi>S. Peter</hi> only had the charge of feeding our Lords Lambs: muſt wee therefore reckon the dead among theſe Lambes? Yea, will ſome ſay, becauſe the Pope therevpon ſheareth them: be it ſo: but is the pulling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the fire, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? 5. Moreover in that the Pope ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his power with the words of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Whatſoever yee ſhall looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven?</hi> Doth he not condemne him ſelfe, in that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beyond his commiſſion? for Chriſt ſaith <hi>All that thou ſhalt looſe on earth:</hi> hee ſaith not, <hi>All that thou ſhalt looſe vnder earth.</hi> It muſt be ſaide that for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this obiection, Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> &amp; after him our doctors haue placed Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory in bathes, in ice, &amp; in the winde.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:11477:120"/>
6. Out of this groweth an other abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and this it is, The Pope looſeth &amp; delivereth the ſouls out of priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which nevertheleſſe he could not binde: how commeth it that the Popes power is is halfe decayed toward theſe ſouls, and that he reſerved himſelfe no more pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er but to looſen? The anſwer is evident: for by binding of ſoules and impoſing puniſhment vpon them hee could get nothing: for no man will giue mony to be tormented, but to be releaſed from torment: he therefore reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much as is profitable. 7. Againe if he be able to draw out any ſoules out of this fire, howe chaunceth it that hee drawes out no more? What humanity is this in him that is tearmed <hi>The holy fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and is the head of the Church, to let his children lie frying in the horrors of a flaming fire, and yet is able to help them out?

him: for he that is iudge of all is not to be iudged of any. Why doth hee not fetch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Purgatory by troops? 8. Neither are we here to alleadge that the Popes giue their pardons to the dead in forme of ſuffrages &amp; interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but not of Iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; abſolute power for in this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is of no import, becauſe it is holden that in whatſoever forme the Pope giveth theſe pardons, they be alwaies of force, and the ſoules be releaſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this fire: there fore our continual demand is this, why he offereth not his Indulgences or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages for more folkes and for longer time then he doth? 9. At the leaſt this remaineth: ſith the Pope pretendeth Iuridical power over the living, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them pardons with Iuriſdiction and power to abſolue from all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paine, why doth he not take order that every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may before his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ful Indulgence? And that everie the ſoules of the faithfull may carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it three or foure hundred
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:11477:123"/>
thouſand yeares of pardon for her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indemnitie? why ſhould the French or Spaniſh be in leſſe favour with God then the enhabitants of Rome? of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none goe to Purgatory vnleſſe he be a very dolt, conſidering that even at his dore he hath ſo many Churches where in in one day he may purchaſe two or three hundred thouſand yeares of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? 10. Again, how is it that the Pope delivereth the ſoules that are not of his charge from ſo long and grievous a tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and yet cannot deliver the living that are (as he ſaith) of his charge from the ſmalleſt paines, diſeaſes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Hereto the Frier in liew of anſwer ſaith J am a foole, and ſo overſlippeth them with many frivolous demands to no purpoſe. 11. Whereof alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it that our Doctors memories are ſo ſhort as to forget that before, hauing ſaid that of neceſſitie the ſoules that haue not ſufficiently ſatisfied in this life muſt be purged in Purgatory ſo to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Iuſtice of God, they can now be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:11477:124"/>
content to permit the Pope by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to fetch the ſoules out of this fire, and thereby hinder both the purging of the ſoules and the ſatisfaction of Gods iuſtice? But if they reply that Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is ſatisfied becauſe the Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth for them the overplus of the merits of Ieſus Chriſt and his Saints, they runne themſelues on the pikes: for why did he not preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to God the ſame merits before the ſoules departed out of their bodies, ſo to exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Purgatory? Or rather why ſhould wee goe into Purgatory at all, ſith Ieſus Chriſt ſitting at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, and offering to his father his benefit for our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, performeth all that the Pope pretendeth to doe?</p>
               <p>Againſt ſo many ſuch pregnant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections our Doctors do ſhroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder a miſerable diſtinction, as vnder a wet net againſt the raine.

                  <hi>Du Val</hi> expoundeth this dictincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſimilitude: he ſaith, If the french King were deſirous to redeeme out of Spaine a priſoner there detained for debts, he would not offer to fetch him thence by authoritie or iuriſdiction, but by ſuffrage and entreatie, offering his debt to the king of Spaine. Here he compareth our King to the Pope, the king of Spaine to God, and Spaine it ſelfe to Purgatory: but that wee muſt ſay is in regard of the Inquiſition.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:11477:134"/>
his reconciliation, but contented himſelfe with that puniſhment that he had vndergone before his abſolution. The Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe pardoning ſins, impoſeth paines and in one ſelfe action firſt looſeth and then bindeth againe. 12. <hi>S. Paule</hi> never reſerved to himſelfe only the autority to giue Indulgences and pardons, as knowing that Ieſus Chriſt ſpake to al the Apoſtles and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, when he ſaid <hi>Whatſoever yee ſhall binde on earth, ſhall bee bound in heaven.</hi> Mat. 18.18. <hi>Alſo whoſe ſinnes you ſhall forgiue they ſhall be forgiven. Ioh. 20.23.</hi> Therefore alſo when he forgaue he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no leaue nor autority of <hi>Peter</hi> or of any other who had the only mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the treaſure of the Church. 13. Laſtly, <hi>S. Paul</hi> diſtributed not to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner any of the ſuperaboundant merits or ſufferings of the Saintes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his ſin: for all his skil, and all his hope is in Ieſus Chriſt crucified: neither doth hee tell vs of any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers. With what conſcience then
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11477:134"/>
can they bring in the example of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to eſtabliſh their Indulgences and the fetching of ſouls out of Purgatorie? As for mee who by theſe our Maſters am provoked and challenged in ſo manie places: may not I now challenge them to ſhew me in al theſe oppoſitions that I haue exhibited, any correſpondence betweene <hi>S Paule</hi> and the Pope? But they will not deale: this they will gently paſſe over, and in liew of reaſons lay vp on me Invectiues and ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders enough. <hi>Cayer</hi> only hath bethought himſelfe of a proofe for the fetching of ſoules out of Purgatory: that is, that vnder the law there was an altar of propitiation: as indeede the others are but dunces to him.</p>
               <p>Here wee are to note wherein the principall abuſe and heape of Impietie doth reſt. That is that the Popes Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences haue no community with the remiſſion of ſinnes propounded in the Goſpell.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:11477:135"/>
remiſſion of ſinnes, and in vertue of their miniſtery doe pronounce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of the ſame, inviting the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to participate in this grace, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haughts of the pardon purchaſed by Ieſus Chriſt. But the Pope giveth his pardons kinglike, in letters patents ſealed with lead in forme of decrees, &amp; thoſe letters diſpatched in chancery.

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:11477:135"/>Doctor <hi>Du Val</hi> goeth farther then al this, and ſaith that theſe be only fleabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and that I trouble my ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground in medling againſt the Pope. Thus in liew of vnknitting the knot, he cutteth it aſunder: and holdeth the encroaching vpon the Maieſtie of God; the eſtabliſhing of a tyranny in the Church: and the ſetting to ſale the remiſſion of ſinnes as it were marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, to be but ſmall abuſes and fleabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. The Frier might haue done more wiſely if hee had imitated his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Indeed in his running away he hath followed him and anſwered nothing to the premiſes: yet hee addeth a childiſh ſlaunder, ſaying: <hi>Du Moulin</hi> findeth abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Indulgences becauſe they are given forth in writing, for he will haue them promulgated verbally. Who did ever heare ſuch a folly? Or where ſpake I ſuch a word? Lift vp your cowl good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and learne to read, but not to ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Let vs now come out of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as out of a ſhop (for indeed it is all but traſh and trafficke) and let vs requite theſe our maſters and Doctors in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, ſuch as being handled in ſchools in Quodlibetary manner, may ſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſteed of Purgations. 1. I will aske firſt where and when the Pope firſt gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither the merits and ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfactions of Saints, &amp; Martyrs, and who gaue him commiſſion to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together this treaſure, or comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded them to gather vp theſe ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory ſatisfactions for the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the puniſhments due to other mens ſinnes? 2. Secondly, who told him that God would accept of the ierkes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes that a penitent giueth himſelfe, or of the labours of <hi>S. Frances,</hi> or <hi>S.

Will a Iudge ſet a priſoner at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie becauſe ſome friend of his hath ſcourged himſelfe or faſted for him? 3. Whether the pardons that the Pope giueth, without enioining any penance be of any force? as alſo thoſe which he giueth with conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to work ſome wickedneſſe as in the yeares 1587 and 1588. when hee gaue ſeven yeares of pardon to every one that would ioine with the holy Vnion: that is to ſay, that would rebell againſt their king, yet he a Roman Catholike? 4. Againe, In as much as theſe ſuperabundant ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Saints are gathered together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Popes treaſurie (becauſe God will haue nothing loſt) how haue the ſuperabundant ſatisfactions of ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly men as died vnder the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as <hi>Moſes, Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> beene husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? be thoſe alſo in the Popes treaſury? But where were they laid vp before the Pope had them? Did they lie lurking in ſome corner two or three thouſand yeares, vntill the Pope gathered them
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:11477:137"/>
together and found meanes to employ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? It were not amiſſe alſo to enquire the reaſon why the world in the yeare of Iubile maketh ſuch haſt to Rome, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded vpon a falſe principle, namely, that who ſo prayeth for a dead body, preſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſeth that there is a Purgatory: but in the laſt Chapter wee will ſhew that the prayers for the dead, which ſome of the ancients did vſe, were even againſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.

they ſhould obtaine their deſires, yet had they gained nothing toward the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of their Purgatory. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we will doe them thus much more then right, that nowe receaving their principle we wil lay open the falſhood and impertinencie of their proofes therevpon. 1.<note place="margin">Cayers paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſages p. 24. A falſhood</note> 
                     <hi>Cayer</hi> ſhall haue the credit to march foremoſt, as the moſt skilfull. His words are theſe. It is ſaid <hi>Numbers 16. v. 47. &amp;. 48.</hi> that <hi>Aaron reconciled the people both the quick and the dead.</hi> A paſſage falſe and by him invented: for as well in the Hebrew, as in the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even in the Roman, it is thus, <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron ſtanding vpright betweene the dead and the living, beſought God for the people: and the plague ceaſed.</hi> 2. In the third book of <hi>Kings. cap. 8. v. 38.</hi> There is a manner of prayer for the dead (ſaith <hi>Cayer</hi>) in theſe words. <hi>Every prayer and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by any man for the wound of his heart in the Church, it ſhall be acceptable to God.</hi> Alſo in the 33. verſe it is ſaid. <hi>If the people fall before their enimies, in praying
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:11477:139"/>
to God they ſhal be heard.</hi> Were not this paſſage falſified, yet ſhew me one word in it that importeth praying for the dead. 3. Againe he ſaith that in the 57. of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet complaineth that they did not pray for the dead. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is falſe, neither is there any ſuch ſpeech throughout all the Chapter. Looke alſo what wee haue already ſaid in the third Chapter and third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 4. He goeth on and ſaith that in the third Chapter of <hi>Baruch</hi> it is ſet downe in expreſſe words: <hi>Heare o Lord God the prayer of the dead Iſraelits, and of their children that haue ſinned before thee.</hi> And ſoone after, <hi>Remember not the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of our Fathers.</hi> Firſt, the booke is Apocriphall: ſecondly, In theſe wordes of <hi>[Iſraell]</hi> are compriſed all the people of Iſraell, who in thoſe daies through the extremitie of their captivitie &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, were as if they lived not, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the eleventh verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>Iſraell is counted with them that go downe to the graue.</hi> Tearming thoſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11477:139"/>
dead, after the ordinary phraſe of the Scripture, that are oppreſſed with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and as it were within two inches of death: As <hi>David</hi> in the 88. Pſalme, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit aliue, counteth himſelfe among the dead and thoſe that goe downe to the pit: ſo alſo in the 18. Pſalme, v. 5. &amp; 6. and in the 116. Pſalme, v. 3. hee ſaith that he is environed and ſurpriſed with the ſnares of death and with the bonds of the ſepulcher. Alſo in the 18. Pſalme v. 19. the faithfull doe deſire of God that he would reſtore them to life, as if they had beene dead, and already brought to the graue. Thirdly, to what purpoſe doth hee come in with a prayer of the dead, conſidering that our queſtion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth only the prayer of the living for the dead. Fourthly, as concerning theſe words <hi>Remember not the iniquitie of our fathers,</hi> hee prayeth that the threats of the lawe, which denounce that <hi>God will viſit the iniquitie of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vpon the children</hi> be not executed vpon them: hee therefore prayeth that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:11477:140"/>
the ſinnes of the fathers be no cauſe to prolong their captivitie, as plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the eight verſe. <hi>Cayer</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth yet another paſſage out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the <hi>Machabes,</hi> but that you ſhal find among the paſſages of the other two. 5. The Frier having diſcharged all his anger vpon <hi>M.

His words are theſe. <hi>The holy Scripture which teacheth vs all that is neceſſary to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth withall forbid vs any thing that may be contrary thereto now let any man ſhewe me ſo much as one place that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to pray for the dead.</hi> The fire of <hi>Helie</hi>

ſaith the ſame:<note place="margin">Pag. 8. 62.</note> only he denieth that the Scripture containeth all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation: and therefore giueth examples. The baptiſme of children: The conſubſtantialitie of the father with the ſonne: The Trinitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp;c. To all the which wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anſwered in the ſecond Chapter. It were good theſe doctors could agree among themſelues. In the meane time in anſwer to the Fryer Iſay. It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen argument, and two of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are falſe: The firſt Propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, <hi>The holy Scripture commanding that which is neceſſary to ſaluation, doth al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo forbid all that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary thereto.</hi> Which we deny, becauſe here the queſtion is of an expreſſe prohibition. For the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er requireth that we ſhould ſhew him ſuch a one: but it is well knowe that God, when hee hath commanded any thing, doth not alwaies in expreſſe words adde the prohibition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: he wil be prayed vnto: but where doth he forbid that we ſhould not pray
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:11477:141"/>
to him? It ſuffiſeth that this prohibition follow the commandement, albeit it be not expreſſed. The ſecond prohibition is alſo falſe, <hi>That prayer for the dead is not forbidden.</hi> For any addition to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God is forbidden <hi>Deut. 4.2.</hi> prayer for the dead is an additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the commandement of God: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbidden, becauſe it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Againe, <hi>Prayer that is not of faith, cannot be acceptable to God, Iames, 1.6 Hebrewes, 11.6.</hi> Prayer for the dead is made without faith, for faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the word of God and is grounded therevpon, but throughout all the worde of God prayer for the dead is not ſpoken of: <hi>It cannot then bee accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God.</hi> Which is more, by the ſame argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we may proue al things: we may ſay that all that is in <hi>Amadis</hi> or in the chronicle of <hi>S. Frances</hi> is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee find not that it is there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted. And let this be ſpoken in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Doctor <hi>Du Val,</hi> who groundeth his Purgatory vpon this, that Ieſus
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:11477:141"/>
Chriſt did not condemne prayer for the dead? which [ſaith hee] was put in practiſe among the Iewes, &amp; yet Ieſus Chriſt never reproued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it. True it is that the Iewes had their abuſes which are not condemned in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.<note place="margin">Ioſeph. in that place ſaith that the Eſſeans in the courſe of their life obſerved Pithagoras rule.</note> As the ſect of the <hi>Eſſeans</hi> witneſſe <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. 5. cap. 17. and <hi>Ioſephus Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatum,</hi> lib 18. cap. 2. And their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was and yet is, <hi>That the Meſsias ſhould be a great Prince, that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the nations and ſubdue them to the Iewes. Ioſephus</hi> alſo in his 12. booke and 2. Chapter. of the warres of the Iewes ſaith that the Phariſes taught the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the ſoules out of one body into another: yet did not Ieſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them for the ſame. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the opinion of praying for the dead, if any of the Iewes were tainted therewith, yet was it not vniverſall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine receaved among them:<note place="margin">Eccl. 49.10</note> beſides that it hath no affinity with Purgatory. For even to this day ſuch Iewes as pray for the dead knowe not what Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:11477:142"/>
is: and their ordinary prayer is that the memory of the dead may be bleſſed 7. Theſe Doctors hauing thus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their reaſons without Sctipture, do now alleage Scripture without reaſon. Thus ſaith the Frier <hi>S. Iames</hi> in his fifth Chapter ſaith, <hi>Pray one for another that yee may be ſaued.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Here S. Iames tyeth not this to the liuing only.</hi> Hee alſo alleageth <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his 20. book of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, who ſaith, that the ſoules of the dead are not ſeperated from the Church. He farther demandeth <hi>whoe told vs whether our Lord, teaching vs to ſay, forgiue vs our treſpaſſes &amp;c. limited this prayer for the living or for the dead?</hi> This alſo is of the like nature and full of ſubteltie.<note place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>taught vs to pray for the dead, when hee Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi> Where he ſaid, <hi>Drinke yee all of this, for this is my bloode of the new Teſtament which ſhall be ſhed for MANY,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>for YOV In ſaying for you &amp; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he meaneth both preſent, abſent, and to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:11477:142"/>
come: therefore it is not for you to limit the will of Ieſus Chriſt only to the living.</hi> To anſwere all this requireth much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though ſmal dexterity: for we are driven to reduce theſe men, as litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the ABC of reaſon. 1. Firſt this paſſage of <hi>S. Iames</hi> is falſified: for <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of the cure of the body, not of the ſalvation of the ſoule, as appeareth by the verſe next before. <hi>Prayer in faith ſhall ſaue the ſicke, and the Lorde ſhall raiſe him vp againe.</hi> And to the like end alſo was this vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely to cure the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed. Thus the Apoſtle healed many diſeaſed by anointing them, <hi>Marke. 16. 13. Tertullian</hi> in his 2. booke <hi>Scepula c. 4.</hi> ſpeaketh of one <hi>Proculus,</hi> who cured the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> by annointing him with oile. 2. I would aske the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doctors to whom <hi>S. Iames</hi> writ: whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther to the living, or to the dead, or to both? Surely he writ to the living: for they vſe to carry no letters into Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: then they whom he commanded to pray were living. 3. What kinde of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:11477:143"/>

What need he to ſeeke ſo farre ſet proofes to proue that which we confeſſe: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth but the blood of Ieſus Chriſt was ſhed for many: for al the faithful: for all the Saints and Martyrs?

As for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of the dead, practiſed by ſome of the ancients in the ſupper, I wil in the next chapter follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing proue that it maketh againſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie: for therein they alſo made a commemoration of the Apoſtles and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:11477:144"/>
Martyrs. And in this place doth the Frier proue himſelfe a moſt ridiculous flatterer, in ſpreading abroad ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negericks and praiſes of Monſieur <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti</hi> [one that deſerveth commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of an honeſter mans mouth] as alſo of our king, who is too wiſe to thinke that ſuch comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſhameleſſe beginnings. But what is become of thoſe daies when men of his coat went in Proceſſion in armes, the pike in one hand &amp; the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuiſe in the other, and were the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of publike combuſtions, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the people againſt their king, whilſt we as good ſubiects, even ſuch as we will be to the death, did ſhed our blood in his ſervice? Of like ſubſtance alſo is the fable that hee patcheth vp of a Maſſe ſong in England for the ſoule of the late Queene, and the offerings contributed in her funerall: wherevpon in full hope he exclaimeth: <hi>At length the truth ſhall riſe out of Democritus well:</hi> you deceaue your ſelfe, good man, ſhe roſe

from thence even in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and primitiue Church: But the divel hath dealt with her as he did with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when hee came out of the well: ſhe hath been ſold to ſtrange marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts brought into bondage, and put in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, not as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was to an Eunuch, but to the father of lies marveilous fruitfull.

This it is. <hi>Iudas ſent to Hieruſalem the ſumme of twelue thouſand drachmes of ſilver to offer ſacrifiſes for the ſinne,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>for the ſinne</hi> not as the Frier ſaith for the dead. Now what theſe wordes <hi>for the ſinne</hi> doth ſignifie ſhall hereafter appeare. That the book is not Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, we haue infinite proofes. 1. Firſt, theſe books are not in the Hebrewe, 2. Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, whoe vpon every occaſion did alleage the paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſages of the old Teſtament, never na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any of theſe bookes, neither out of them cited any paſſage. 3. The Autor himſelfe cap. 2. v. 19. ſaith that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to abridge the fiue bookes of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> the Cirinean into one booke: Now if <hi>Iaſons</hi> bookes were not Canonicall, how can the abſtract of them be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall? If <hi>Trogus</hi> or <hi>Dyon</hi> bee prophane bookes, how can <hi>Iuſtine</hi> or <hi>Xiphiline</hi> be ſacred. <hi>S. Paule, 2. Tim. 3.16.</hi> ſaith <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God:</hi> But what inſpiration is it to ſay the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:11477:146"/>
ſame that another in a prophane booke hath ſpoken, and only to abridge his words? What more? The Autor doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whether he had ſaid well, toward the ende concludeth thus. <hi>If I haue ſaid well and as it appertaineth to the history, it is as much as I deſire.</hi> Are the motions of the ſpirit of God ſo inſenſible or doubtfull as to leaue the mind in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe and vncertaine, concerning the excellency of ſuch things as it hath ſug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geſted; a little after hee excuſeth the ſimplicitie of his ſtile. Will God who hath no intereſt to be beleeued, whoſe naked words doe farre exceed the moſt poliſhed words of man excuſe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of his owne phraſe? Or ſhall not hee that made the tongue haue elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough? yes, for hee inſpireth his ſervants with ſo much eloquence as he thinketh good: neither is it for vs either to diſtaſt it or to bring excuſes. But in the reading of theſe books how many things doe weaken their autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? In the ſecond of the <hi>Machabes, 1.19.</hi>

before wonne from <hi>Antiochus.</hi> For as for the Indies the Romans never ſawe them: and when their Empire was at the higheſt, they neverwent far beyond <hi>Euphrates.</hi> But the moſt notable of all is that in the 16. verſe, it is ſaid that the Romans yearely committed their eſtat to one man, conſidering it is manifeſt that yearely they created two Conſuls, whereof the proofe were ſuperfluous.

Ieſus Chriſt haue ſpoken [ſay our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters] if there were not ſome ſinnes that ſhall not be forgiven in this world, but ſhall in the world to come: and this world to come is Purgatory: wherein their memory faileth them: for they ſay that Purgatory was already in the time of Ieſus Chriſt, then could not Ieſus Chriſt call it in the world to come.

Now herein I muſt fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe that the auctor of the fire of <hi>Helie</hi> hath yet ſome dexterity in ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry:<note place="margin">Du Val.</note> but the Frier ſpeaketh like an Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot and a man of a craſed braine, for all his diſcourſe is ſpent in laying of max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes and principles, whereby hee will haue this caſe decided, as if it were in him to impoſe lawes and principles in this buſineſſe. And indeed if you looke narrowly into the matter, you ſhall finde theſe principles to bee the caſe it ſelfe: for they ſet downe as a plaine caſe and confeſſed, that in this fire the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are tormented, and do feele the trial of this fire. Now this is the point of the controverſie and that which wee doe ſtiffe and ſtedfaſtly deny: that <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſpeaketh no ſuch thing. Howbeit in the end he muſt haue the grace of it, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth my ſlackneſſe, as being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comprehend his ſo childiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. As for the explication of this
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:11477:176"/>
paſſage, it muſt be gathered out of that that goeth before. <hi>S. Paule</hi> in the 5. verſe of this chapter ſpeaketh of doctors and paſtours, and of the preaching of the Goſpell. And particularly of Doctors, who holding a good foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is Jeſus Chriſt, do nevertheleſſe adde of their inventions and ſlight doctrines, which he calleth <hi>wood, hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> in regard of the pure and ſolide doctrine, which he tearmeth <hi>Gold, ſilver</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtones.</hi> This wood therefore &amp; this ſtubble being examined by the word of God, as mettals in fire, can not ſubſiſt, but muſt needs be conſumed. But as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the parſon of the paſtor he ſhal be ſaved in regard of the good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he hath holden, yet after triall made as it were by fire. This explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is naturall, and ſpringeth of it ſelfe: and every one that knoweth that <hi>S.

                  <p n="21">21 <hi>Cayer</hi> obſtinately armeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to make vſe of the reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his proofe of Purgatory: and yet is this argument trivial among our adverſaries: The ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> [ſaie they] where was it before it did riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? It was not in hell: for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence none commeth againe: neither in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: for then Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde haue done him wrong to fetch him from thence: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt there be a third place, and the taile that they here adde is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: that is, that this third place is a place of torment,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.25.</note> and a fire called Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. Hereto we ſay, That the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Chriſt raiſed was in the ſame place with the ſoule of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lazarus</hi> mentioned in the <hi>16.</hi> of <hi>Luke,</hi> that is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, which is no place of torment: for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was there, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt ſaith that <hi>Lazarus</hi> after the miſeries of this life was comforted. Neither ſhould our adverſaries thinke it ſtrange that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:11477:178"/>
God taketh a ſoule out of the place of reſt, to returne it for a ſhort time into a place of combat and affliction, ſith Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in <hi>Iohn 11.4.</hi> ſaith that it was done to the end the ſon of God might bee glorified: for the glorie of God ought alwaies to take place aboue all particular intereſt: beſides that God was able afterward to reward him with greater glory: The beſt is that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries at vnawares do argue againſt themſelues: for they beleeue that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elyas</hi> men already bleſſed, ſhal returne downe to fight againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and ſhall ſuffer perſecution, yea and death it ſelfe. They alſo ſay that the Pythoneſſe fetched the ſoule of <hi>Samuel</hi> from his reſt. If they hold that God per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted this to a witch &amp; ſorcereſſe for the contenting of the vngodly curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Saule,</hi> why wil they not permit as much to Ieſus Chriſt for the glorie of God and the advancement of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? But if this <hi>Lazarus</hi> came forth of a burning fire, why brought he no news?
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:11477:178"/>
Or could hee conceale a matter of ſuch importance? or had he ſo ſoone forgot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten ſo ſenſible a torment? There are yet two paſſages that are common to all theſe doctors, <hi>S. Paule, Philip. 2.10.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Like as at the name of Ieſus everie knee ſhould bowe, both of things in heaven, of things in earth, and of things vnder the earth.</hi> Alſo in the fifth of the <hi>Revelation. And all the creatures which are in heaven and on the earth, or vnder the earth, and in the ſea, yea and all things comprehended in them heard I ſaying: to him that ſitteth on the throne, and to the lambe be praiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, &amp;c.</hi> With theſe paſſages they blow their Imaginary fire, and ſay that they that are in heaven are the Saints: They that are vpon the earth are the people living. That they are vnder the earth are the ſoules that are tormented in Purgatory. 1. But who ſhall bee the creatures that are in the ſea? The fire of <hi>Helie</hi> ſaith. They be the inhabitants of the Ilands: that is to ſay. The Engliſh, the Corſes: the Candiots, &amp;c. He taketh
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:11477:179"/>
theſe people to bee creatures that are not vpon the earth. Let vs not laugh but proceed and heare how he proveth it. He produceth the ſixt of <hi>Eſay</hi> in theſe words. <hi>Thy heart ſhall reioice when the whole multitude of the ſea ſhall come vnto thee.</hi> A paſſage for the purpoſe. But read over all the whole Chapter and I will turne Munke if you find any ſuch word. 2. But why doe they rather ſay that they be the ſoules in Purgatory, then the ſoules of children that died without baptiſme, who they ſay are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth. 3. Withall note that they adde a prettie patch which S. <hi>Paule</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had forgotten: namely that they that are vnder the earth are tormented in fire for a time: for in defence of new Divinitie wee muſt ſeeke new Logicke. 4. Neither are we to omit that this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is become a paire of bellowes to Purgatory. Sith they hold that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground: for according to Pope <hi>Gregory, Alcuyne, Peter Damyan,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that place Purgatory in bathes,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:11477:179"/>
in Rivers, in the Ice, in the winde, and vnder the leaues, this paſſage is to no vſe. And ſurely the fire of <hi>Helie</hi> who ſaith that the Church hath defined nothing concerning the place where Purgatory ſtandeth,<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> hath greatly overſhot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in vſing this paſſage and defining that Purgatory is vnder the ground.</p>
                  <p>Now to proue that thoſe that are vnder the earth are not the divels, they vrge theſe words of <hi>bowing the knee</hi> alſo theſe words of <hi>giuing praiſe and glory</hi> which the Frier falſely accuſeth me to haue omitted. They ſay then that the divels never bow their knees before God, neither praiſe him. For the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knee doth import a ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and voluntary obedience. 5. In anſwere I ſay that S. <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe in this ſelfe place ſhall decide this controverſie: For in ſaying that <hi>every knee ſhall bow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sclander</note> 
                     <hi>of thoſe that are in earth,</hi> he evidently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all men both good &amp; bad: whereby it appeareth that bowing the knee doth not in this place ſignifie vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:11477:180"/>
and religiouſly to ſerue, but only to bee in ſubiection: or elſe they muſt ſay that the wicked doe volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſerue Ieſus Chriſt. 6. Alſo in this place S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſoveraign Empire given to Ieſus Chriſt over all creatures, then withall over the wicked and divels which haue beene and ſhall be forced to giue glory to Ieſus Chriſt. 7. Wee haue another paſſage of the ſame Apoſtle taken out of the fiue and forty of <hi>Eſay</hi> where this word to bowe the knee is plainely expounded:<note place="margin">Luk 8.27.28.</note> for in the 14. to the Romans he ſpeaketh thus of the laſt iudgement. <hi>We ſhall all appeare before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, for it is written I liue ſaith the Lord: let everie knee bow before me, and every tongue giue praiſe vnto God.</hi> In this place S. <hi>Paule</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to appeare before the iudgement ſeat of God, for bowing the knee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. The wicked therefore &amp; the divels ſhall bow the knee becauſe they ſhall appeare and be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the iuſtice of God. In this regard
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:11477:180"/>
doth <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> in his dialogue againſt <hi>Triphon</hi> ſay that the Infernall ſpirits are ſubiect to Ieſus Chriſt bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their knees at the bare pronounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Croſſe. 8. As for the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpoken of in the fifth of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are the praiſes of all creaturs: of whom, even of the inanimate, as of the heauens, the earth, the ſonne, &amp;c. The Scripture in aboue a hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſaith that they praiſe the eternall:<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. Pſal. 140. Pſal. 145.</note> eſpecially in the Pſalme 148. where this is repeated ſome twentie times. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need we goe any further then this paſſage, namely of the Revelation to proue it. For he ſaith, <hi>I heard EVERT CREATVRE which is in heauen:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunne, the ſtarres, the Angels, &amp;c. he alſo ſaith, <hi>All that is on the earth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, and in the ſea, yea even all things that are compriſed in them, &amp;c.</hi> It appeareth then that he ſpeaketh of all creatures: and this is it that made our adverſaries to omit theſe words <hi>yea all things that are compriſed in them,</hi> with
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:11477:181"/>
a notable falſehood according to their cuſtome, thereby to abate the edge of Gods word and to take from him that which pierceth the very vntruth. I ſhould wrong the autor of the fire of <hi>Helie</hi> if I ſhould ſuppreſſe one inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he doth very gallantly produce to ſhewe that the divels doe not bowe to Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>If</hi> [ſaith he] <hi>Du Moulin himſelfe will not put of his hat when wee ſpeake of the name of Ieſus how can the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels be forced to doe it?</hi> The divels then by this Doctors ſaying, doe wear hats, but they will not put them of when we ſpeake of Ieſus. Is it becauſe they are ſomewhat ſurly and prowd, or for that they feare the aire? Note alſo that by this argument taken from the more to the leſſe, hee doeth vs this honour that hee holdeth vs leſſe wicked then the divels: and yet wee flee not for his holy water. But in the end I ſay this doctor is deceived in one point, and deceiveth in an other: hee is deceived in that he thinketh that by the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:11477:181"/>
name of Ieſus <hi>Saint Paule</hi> in this place meant the word <hi>IESVS</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that the ſcripture by the name of God ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily vnderſtandeth his auctority, his glory, his ſtrength, his power, &amp;c. and ſo ſay we, <hi>Our helpe be in the name of God</hi> alſo <hi>hallowed bee thy name</hi> and <hi>I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee in the name of the Eternall. 2. Sam. 17.45.</hi> In this ſenſe we honour the name of Ieſus: but our adverſaries ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the ſyllables: and thereof commeth the feaſt &amp; Maſſe of the name of Ieſus: for as concerning his parſon there is a feaſt apart. But in this that he falſely ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſeth vs, he deceiveth. For if a man hearing the name of Ieſus putteth of his hat, we like it well, ſo as it be done without ſuperſtition. But marke what it is. They vſe many ſalutations to the name of Ieſus, whiles in the mean time his parſon is wronged and his benefite abuſed: and they finde out other redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and an other purging for our ſins: he is entreated as he was by thoſe that buffeted him ſaying vnto him, <hi>All haile:</hi>

Thus is Religion corrupted, which at this day hold her handes in rule and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth godlineſſe her paſport. Hereof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that the ſervice of the Church of Rome, namely the Maſſe conſiſteth in geſtures, in a ſet number of bowings in frisking from one end of the alter to the other, in Allegoricall habites, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at pleaſure, whiles the people loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on learneth nothing: and is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with geſtures, when they ſhould be inſtructed by the intelligible worde.

They do indeed ſpeak of the fire of the laſt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: likewiſe that they make mention of a torment reſerved to thoſe only that haue not ſufficiently ſatisfied in this life when they ſpeake but of a torment or purgation common to all the faithfull, to the ſaints, to the Martyrs and to the Virgin Mary. And this is a ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their vnfaithfulneſſe in their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations.</p>

We haue heard in the ſecond of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> that to pray for the dead is but meere madneſſe: vnleſſe we haue regard to the Reſurrection: ſo not to the torment of Purgatory. 6.

What more can we deſire? Let vs make our adverſaries our iudges in this caſe. Do not the Prieſts many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue money for ſaying Maſſes for the young children that dyed ſoone after Baptiſme, who nevertheleſſe [as they beleeved] were neither in Limbo, nor in Purgatory?

want of knowledge, or their bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. 12. Do they not in their dailie Maſſe pray for the ſoules that ſleepe in a ſlumber of peace and therfore are not in the horror of flames. 13. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare the forme of the ordinarie praiers of the Church of Rome for the dead.<note place="margin">This book of ſacred cerem. ſect 5. c. 1. libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra domine à morte ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e illo tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo</note>

Finally, is it not a matter mervailous notable that among ſuch a multitude of the paſſages of the fathers, by our adverſaries quoted for praier for the dead, there is not one that ſaith that theſe praiers were made to redeeme ſoules out of Purgatory? This the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the fourth degree of the deceipts and fraudulent allegations that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries do make, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at every ſpeech they ſtill inculcate praier for the dead for proofe of their Purgatory: &amp; there vpon haue they ſpent at the leaſt three quarters of their allegations.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning this praier for the dead, the truth is that the Apoſtles in the celebration of the Lords Supper retained the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt: and Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath before teſtified vnto vs that to that Inſtitution that is ſet downe in the holy Goſpell they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only the Lords praier, which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an vntruth in <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who ſaith that the Commemoration of the dead in the Euchariſt is an Apoſtolicall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:11477:220"/>
Soone after Martyrdome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, for the better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtians, they brought in a cuſtome in the celebration of the ſacrament, to name the Martyrs with the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Church they had a liſt or double ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles called Diptiches, wherin were writ ten the names of all ſuch deceaſed as were to be mentioned in Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo far there was no harme.</p>
                  <p>The cuſtome encreaſing, the parents and friends of the deceaſed beganne to giue almes vpon the day of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the deceaſed. The almes togither with the commemorations they called oblations of the dead: alſo ſacrifices for the dead: as we may ſee in the ſixt epiſtle of the third book of <hi>S.

The Biſhop or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter prayeth, <hi>We doe offer vnto thee for all thoſe that haue pleaſed thee from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, for the Saints, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, Prophets, righteous men, Apoſtles, Martyrs. &amp;c.</hi> For ſuch doth the Church of Rome hold that wee ought not to pray or to offer. That theſe oblations and ſacrifices were almes it appeareth by two Canons:<note place="margin">Vaſes, Can. qui oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; can.

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:11477:222"/>
of a certaine deceaſed perſon, who had charged a clarke with a tutorſhip: for ſurely it had beene exceſſiue inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to depriue a ſoule tormented in fire from ordinary reliefe for ſo ſlight an of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fence, and where it was rather want of conſideration then of piety: as alſo to hold ſuch a one for that ſinne to be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were a raſh and precipitat iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>In thoſe daies ſprang vp the error of the receptacles of ſoules, and of the fire of the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that ſhould purge even the Virgin Mary and the Apoſtles, &amp; began to take footing in the church.

Then began theſe great donations to the Church: eſpecially after the ſtations and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of Rome were added, which are of the topgallant, &amp; the laſt &amp; ſupream top of all Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this progreſſe of abuſe what better remedy then to reduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the ſpring head, which is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture?

was no prayer either for the dead, or to fetch any ſoule out of Purgatory: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the daies of Ieſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles, nor of a long time after.

Our adverſaries, like the Iſraelites that gathered ſtraw vnder the bondage of <hi>Pharao,</hi> for want of more ſubſtantiall proofes, doe make vſe of this cuſtome in their eſtabliſhing of the Popes Indulgences, and in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bution of the overplus workes and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant ſatisfactions of the Saints collected into the Popes treaſurie and converted into paimentes for others:<note place="margin">Tertullian calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appointed Martyrs</note> wherein I ſuppoſe they haue no intent that men ſhould beleeue them: ſo farre from all apparance doe they ſpeake. 1.

Wee cannot finde that ever the paine of any ſinner was abridged by the merits and ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſufferings of theſe Martyres, who would never haue vndergon thoſe torments, had they not beleeved that God called them thereto, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they were bound to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them, &amp; ſo it followeth that they neither did, nor ſuffered any thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatory. for they could not doe otherwiſe, vnleſſe they would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Goſpell. 3. Theſe impriſoned Martyrs commended to the Church this or that penitent, and beſought that they might be receaued into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: but they neither paid for them nor redeemed them: as our adverſaries doe ſay that the Saints by their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are in ſome ſort our redeemers. 4. Theſe Martyrs entreated only that the ſinner might bee admitted to the Communion: not that he might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Purgatory. 5. In thoſe daies there was no ſpeech of this worthie treaſure of the Church, compoſed of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:11477:225"/>

Every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop impoſed or abridged the pains or excommunications in his owne flocke without expecting either advice or buls from the Biſhop of Rome. 7. In thoſe daies men knew not the meaning of pardons hanged vpon certain Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by his holineſſe autoritie. O what a goodly ſight it would haue beene in thoſe daies to haue ſeene ſuch buls ſet vp and fixed vpon the Church dores, or ſome one that might haue inſtructed the people in this new Goſpell: namely that his Papall holineſſe, having in his treaſury all the ſuperabundant ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ieſus Chriſt &amp; his Saints, doth giue ten thouſande or fiftie thouſande yeares of plenary pardon, and as many quarentines, with the third of all their ſinnes, or even full Indulgence to every one that ſhall ſay a ſtinted number of Paters or Avees, or his roſary or beads, or weare or kiſſe ſome halowed grains: or contribute ſome peece of mony; or that ſhall ioine himſelfe to the fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

Surely I ſay if any man in the primitiue Church ſhould ſhaue preached ſo prodigious a doctrine, even the little children would haue hiſſed after him or the Phiſitians would haue felt his pulſe, ſo to haue learned the cauſe of his frenſey, and to purge his hypochondriall humour: for as yet it was not the cuſtome to burne any man for hereſie.
